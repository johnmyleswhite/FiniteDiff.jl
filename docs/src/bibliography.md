# Reading Material

A good introduction to numerical differentiation via finite differences is on
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_differentiation). After
reading that article, we suggest reading Section 5.7 in "Numeric Recipes in C",
which has a full citation below.

In addition, there is interesting material in the SciPy proposal to add support
for numerical differentiation. The SciPy proposal can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/wiki/Proposal:-add-finite-difference-numerical-derivatives-as-scipy.diff).
